# Todolist App

A simple and modern Todo List application built using **React Native** and **Expo**. This app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, toggling status (done/undone), and deleting them directly from the task list.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Users can input a task title and add it to the list. The status of the task is initially set to "Due" (undone).
- **Toggle Task Status**: Users can easily toggle the task status between "Done" and "Due" using a switch directly on the task card.
- **Delete a Task**: Users can delete a task by tapping on the delete icon (trash) on the task card.
- **Visual Feedback**: Tasks marked as "Done" will have a strikethrough and green color, while "Due" tasks are shown in default text color.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Expo CLI**: This app is built using Expo. If you haven't installed Expo CLI, you can do so by running:
